Developed with input and insights from the people of Surat, the Resilience Strategy is designed to articulate solutions that make our city more resilient not only to physical challenges, such as floods and aging infrastructure, but also to social challenges, such as cohesion and urban health. Surat’s Resilience Strategy is the launch point for several programs that foster these connections and partnerships. These programs that I am excited about, will enable several community-based organizations to serve as hosts for training and conduits to services that are tailored to meet the needs of people. These programs are good example of what the practice of resilience looks like—it addresses more than one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people. I am proud of the many partnerships that have made the Resilience Strategy possible, and I look forward to forming many additional partnerships that will enable its implementation. 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)—pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation—has provided invaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Other Indian cities— Chennai, Pune, and Jaipur—are also participating in 100RC, and continued collaboration in the region will help to amplify our work beyond the boundaries of our respective cities. Most of all, I am grateful to the Surat community for contributing to the Resilience Strategy and for what you do every day to make Surat the active, dynamic, and highly engaged community that it is. I invite all community members to review this report with an eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, and colleagues in making Surat a model of city resilience. \n",

For instance, 'education', 'health services', 'workforce development', and 'youth opportunity programs' are present in Seattle's metrics but not in Surat's. On the other hand, 'water quality', 'social cohesion', 'waste management', 'law enforcement', 'integration', 'public participation', 'connectivity mobility', and 'environment ecosystem' are present in Surat's metrics but not in Seattle's.\n",

In Seattle, 'education' has the highest score, suggesting it's a major focus of their strategy. In Surat, 'pollution' has the highest score, suggesting it's a major focus there.\n",
