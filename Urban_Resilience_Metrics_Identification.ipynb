For instance, 'education', 'health services', 'workforce development', and 'youth opportunity programs' are present in Seattle's metrics but not in Surat's. On the other hand, 'water quality', 'social cohesion', 'waste management', 'law enforcement', 'integration', 'public participation', 'connectivity mobility', and 'environment ecosystem' are present in Surat's metrics but not in Seattle's.\n",

In Seattle, 'education' has the highest score, suggesting it's a major focus of their strategy. In Surat, 'pollution' has the highest score, suggesting it's a major focus there.\n",
