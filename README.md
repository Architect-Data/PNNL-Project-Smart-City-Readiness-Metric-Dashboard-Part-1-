# Urban-Resilience-Metric-Identification
Urban resilience is the capability of a city to survive, adapt and thrive in chronic stresses and acute shocks. The goal of this project is to leverage the NLP capabilities to automatically harvest, extract, categorize as defined by major worldwide cities.

Rockefeller foundation conducted city resilience research on selected 100 different cities worldwide. The foundation reserached, and provided resilience strategy to overcome city's socioeconomic and different stresses the city encounters. This project looks into key resilience metric defining the universal metric that define the cities using techniques such as topic modeling (LDA), Spacy, NLTK, TF-IDF, etc. 

This is a project I'm working with a company based in Seattle currently. More will be updated.
