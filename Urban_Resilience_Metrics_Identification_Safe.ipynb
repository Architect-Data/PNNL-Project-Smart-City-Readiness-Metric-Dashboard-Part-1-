Developed with input and insights from the people of Surat, the Resilience Strategy is designed to articulate solutions that make our city more resilient not only to physical challenges, such as floods and aging infrastructure, but also to social challenges, such as cohesion and urban health. Surat’s Resilience Strategy is the launch point for several programs that foster these connections and partnerships. These programs that I am excited about, will enable several community-based organizations to serve as hosts for training and conduits to services that are tailored to meet the needs of people. These programs are good example of what the practice of resilience looks like—it addresses more than one challenge at once and creates multiple benefits for many people. I am proud of the many partnerships that have made the Resilience Strategy possible, and I look forward to forming many additional partnerships that will enable its implementation. 100 Resilient Cities (100RC)—pioneered by The Rockefeller Foundation—has provided invaluable support, guidance, and access to technical assistance. Other Indian cities— Chennai, Pune, and Jaipur—are also participating in 100RC, and continued collaboration in the region will help to amplify our work beyond the boundaries of our respective cities. Most of all, I am grateful to the Surat community for contributing to the Resilience Strategy and for what you do every day to make Surat the active, dynamic, and highly engaged community that it is. I invite all community members to review this report with an eye towards how you can join your friends, neighbors, and colleagues in making Surat a model of city resilience. \n",

Urban Resilience is about facing and learning to adapt to hard challenges in ways that look towards the future. It’s about being able to shift our point of view, redefine our goals and develop skills that make us stronger. Resilience is all about dynamic transformation. Athens has survived and is still adapting to a lot of adversity. We still need however to find ways to do it better. To see our challenges as opportunities that can make us thrive in the near future.

These connections can stimulate not only thought but also action.

Unprecedented levels of unemployment, poverty and homelessness grew in our city, exposing our lack of preparation, together with the pressing need to have systems in place able to provide for the basic needs of the most exposed. The City of Athens rose to the challenge: through partnerships with NGOs and the private sector we built and are still building a robust system for critical relief and social services as well as a rationalized system of data collection and logistics. Moving forward, such partnerships, no less than such data collection and development systems, should be scaled-up and replicated horizontally in city government, leading to an open and vibrant city where data based decision making, transparency and accountability.\n",

The Athens Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Action Plans, an outcome of our collaboration with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, are a fundamental part of this Resilience Strategy. They outline concrete steps for improving the urban quality of life in the face of increasing temperatures, flash floods and bad air quality.

Between 1951 and 1981, the population of the urban area more than doubled, from 1,379,000 to 3,027,090 inhabitants. Economic growth and entry into the EU in 1981 brought new investment and credit which raised the standard of living. Massive housing construction quickly changed the character of Athens, imposing a modern but at times haphazard character. New infrastructure developed, such as public transportation, but growth was chaotic with a proliferation of “polykatoikia,” the multi-story residential building.

Athens thus avoided the creation of urban “ghettos.” At the same time, the “polykatoikias” present extraordinary fragmentation. It is not unusual for a block in the city center to have over 500 different owners. In the early 1980s, the stress of urban congestion, traffic, noise, Urban Heat Island (UHI) and air pollution resulted in urban flight and a move to the suburbs. But Athens remained among the most dense municipalities in the developed world.\n",

The plan marked an ambitious effort to curb sprawl, reduce social disparities and enhance the environmental protection, all from an institutional and regulatory perspective. However, the selection of Athens as host city of the 2004 Olympic Games meant that metropolitan spatial planning was bypassed in favor of urgent, large infrastructure needs. A wave of developments transformed the metropolitan area enabling urban sprawl and increasing car dependency. The Olympic Games ended up being a lost opportunity for a long-term metropolitan strategic plan. Ten years on, the debate on the metropolitan governance of Athens has not led anywhere.In the absence of integrated planning the pressure on the natural environment grew exponentially. Massive construction and a rapidly growing road system signified a depletion of peri-urban green and the covering of the majority of the natural water network of the Attica plain including its two rivers. This has directly contributed to increased temperatures and recurring flush-floods today as well as increasing the risk of earthquake damages. \n",

Creating a major shock for the city Athens, with very little infrastructure in place or experience in refugee reception, suddenly found itself in the forefront of the biggest refugee movement since World War II in Europe.

Along with all the other cities we also identified our city’s critical assets, shocks and stresses. Based on these diagnostic activities, in July 2016, we released Athens’s Preliminary Resilience Assessment (PRA). The PRA set the resilience baseline for Athens, introducing 5 discovery areas that the city had to explore more in order to discover opportunities that would help it built its resilience.

From early on, our office collaborated closely with the C40 Advisor for Athens, leading to the first Athens Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Plan (April 2017). This collaboration in Athens anticipated and underscored the official partnership developed between the 100RC Network and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (December 2016). The connections with other strategic documents elevates the Athens Resilient Strategy’s integration and robustness, bridging the gaps between different institutions as well as gaps that exist between the city’s everyday management and its long-term policy commitments and goals.

This ensured that resilience was embedded in the actions bringing the broadest possible benefits to the city. We then further evaluated our 138 opportunities during Athens Field of Opportunities (FoO). The FoO ensured the Athens Resilient Strategy is fact-based and data-driven but also, thought its making, a result of transparent and extensive dialogue and consultation with many relevant stakeholders.

The city will upscale this methodology in depressed but liveable areas such as Victoria square and parts of Kypseli district.
